The voice assistant for Visual Studio Code. This extension allows you to put code snippets into the code by voice. Also, you can execute any Visual Studio command by voice. The extension works with any language, because the file with voice commands is placed in the project folder (voice-assistant.json). So, you can prepare own voice commands for each project.
